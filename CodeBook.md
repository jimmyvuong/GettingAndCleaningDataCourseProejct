Introduction
The script run_analysis.R performs steps 1-5 from the Course Project.

Step 1 - merges the training and test datasets for activity, subject, and features by using the rbind() function to union the results of each respective dataset.
After the datasets have been created, we provide friendly names to each column in the respective data sets.  Once this is complete, we combine the data into one by using the cbind() function.
Step 2 - extract only the means and standard deviation measurements by subsetting our dataset we combined in step 1.
Step 3 - obtain the descriptive names for the activity dataset by looking at the activity_labels.txt file
Step 4 - renamed the combined dataset with friendly names
Step 5 - output the data to a tidy data set


Variables
activity_test_data, activity_train_data, subject_test_data, subject_train_data, features_test_data, and features_train_data contain the data from the downloaded files.
activity_data is the union data for activity test and train.
subject_data is the union data for subject test and train.
features_data is the union data for features test and train.
all_data is the combined data from activity_data, subject_data, and features_data.
features_names_mean_std_data contains a vector of the mean and standard deviation measurement we are interested in.
activity_lables contains the decriptive lables for the activities data set
output_tiday_data.txt is the text file output using the write.table() function from plyr package for all subject and activity and their appropriate mean and standard deviation measurements.
